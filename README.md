# Insurance-Prediction
This project is a FastAPI-based machine learning model deployment where the backend serves predictions via REST APIs. It loads a pre-trained model (e.g., a classification or regression model) built with scikit-learn and exposes an endpoint that clients can query with input data to receive real-time predictions.



## Features

- Built with FastAPI
- Loads a pre-trained ML model using `pickle`
- Accepts JSON input for predictions
- Returns predicted output

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whyuwe
Insurance-Prediction.git
   cd Insurance-Prediction
