# Insurance-Prediction
This project is a FastAPI-based machine learning model deployment where the backend serves predictions via REST APIs. It loads a pre-trained model (e.g., a classification or regression model) built with scikit-learn and exposes an endpoint that clients can query with input data to receive real-time predictions.
